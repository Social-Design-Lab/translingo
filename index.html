            data-text="Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a beautiful magical flower garden. Every day, children from the village would visit the garden to play and pick their favorite flowers. The flowers were colorful and had the sweetest scents, making the garden a happy place for everyone. 
&#10;One sunny day, a little girl named Lily discovered that if she sang to the flowers, they would grow even more beautiful. Excited by her discovery, she shared the secret with her friends. The children decided to have a singing contest in the garden to see who could make the flowers grow the most.
&#10;Each child chose a flower as their partner and began singing to them. As the children sang, the flowers started to dance, and their colors became even more vibrant. The children's laughter filled the air as they watched the garden transform into a magical wonderland.
&#10;As the sun began to set, the children gathered around to see which flower had grown the most. To their surprise, all the flowers had grown equally, making it impossible to pick a winner. The children decided that the real winner was the garden itself, as it brought them so much joy and happiness.
&#10;From that day on, the children would gather every day and sing to the flowers, making the garden a more enchanting place. The magical flower garden became a symbol of friendship, love, and unity in the village, and the children learned the importance of working together and spreading happiness.">

        <p class="given-text" data-condition="sh" data-text="In a small village, there was a cloud that could change colors. The villagers called it the Rainbow Cloud. It would appear in the sky every day, spreading joy and happiness to everyone who saw it. One day, a group of children decided to find the Rainbow Cloud and learn the secret behind its beautiful colors. They embarked on a journey, following the cloud as it drifted across the sky.
&#10;As they walked, they encountered a wise old man who told them that the Rainbow Cloud gained its colors by helping others. Intrigued, the children continued their journey, determined to see the cloud in action.
&#10;Soon, they came across a sad little girl who had lost her kitten. The Rainbow Cloud heard her cries and swooped down, lifting the kitten from a tall tree and gently placing it in her arms. As it did so, the cloud changed from red to orange. Next, the children found an old lady struggling to carry a heavy basket of fruit. The Rainbow Cloud noticed her struggle and gently lifted the basket, carrying it to her home. As it helped, the cloud turned from orange to yellow.
&#10;Throughout the day, the children witnessed the Rainbow Cloud helping others, each time changing to a new color. By the end of the day, the cloud had transformed into a beautiful, vibrant rainbow.
&#10;The children realized that the Rainbow Cloud's secret was kindness. They returned to their village, inspired to spread love and joy, just like the Rainbow Cloud. From that day on, the village became a happier place, and the Rainbow Cloud continued to bring color and joy to everyone it encountered.
